A Program to demonstrate how to configure the multiple interceptors to single URL with order by using order method:
Programs:
* AppConfig.java
* AppInit.java
* ActionHandlerController.java
* ActionHandlerInterceptor1.java
* ActionHandlerInterceptor2.java
* ActionHandlerInterceptor3.java
Notes:
* To mention the order to execute the interceptors InterceptorRegistration class given order method.
* public InterceptorRegistration order(int order) method to mention order, it accept int value.
* if order is low then that interceptor will execute first and order is high then that interceptor will execute last.
